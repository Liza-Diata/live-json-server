        "description": "Gizela ‘Gigi’ Poblador started practicing Ashtanga yoga in 2007. “I didn’t expect my practice to help me cope with life off the mat. But it did!” Soon after she turned the corner and became a serious practitioner. In 2012, she completed a 200-hour teacher training with John Scott. She has also attended workshops with A.G. Mohan, Richard Freeman, David Keil and recently finished an Intermediate Teacher Training with Hart Lazer that focused on a therapeutic approach.",
